            <p>All provisions of this contract are subject to change from time to time at the discretion of Intera Games without notice. Subscriber understands that change to the ToS by Intera Games shall not be grounds for early contract termination or non-payment.</p>

            <p>By accepting these terms you indicate that you also agree to the Minecraft End User License Agreement.</p>

            <h2>Refund and Disputes</h2>
            <p>Servers are eligible for full refunds within 48 hours of the creation of the server in our database. This point is not marked by the time at which your initial payment is processed and may differ by several hours or days. All completed server upgrade orders are final and not refundable. In agreeing to this Terms of Service you affirm that your order begins within a 7 day “cooling-off” period, and we reserve the right to charge for the time utilized on your service prior to your cancellation.</p>

            <p>The following, but not limited to, services are not eligible for refund: any service purchased with a promotional code, any domain name purchase.</p>

            <p>We may require additional information in order to process any refunds. After receiving a refund request, process the refund through the payment gateway that you used.

Customers may request immediate cancellations though the helpdesk, by submitting a billing ticket. Immediate cancellations are permanent and cannot be aborted. Immediate cancellations will be terminated immediately and all data will be destroyed. A cancellation request does not guarantee a refund – a refund must be explicitly requested and is subject to our Refunds and Disputes policies.</p>

            <h2>Billing and Late Fees</h2>
            <p>An invoice will be added to your account 14 days before your server is set to be renewed. You will receive an email reminding you to pay your invoice 7 days prior to the due date.
